# featured-product
A Wordpress plugin that provides a widget to randomly rotate featured items.  Supports two store-specific links per featured item.
The idea is that you can have the same product listed at different stores (e.g. Etsy and Craftsy) and
wish to give the customer a choice of stores to buy from.

Also supports a link to your Shop Page.
